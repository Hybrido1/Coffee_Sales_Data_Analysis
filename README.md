 Coffee Sales Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data from a vending machine to extract actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The dataset spans March to July 2024 and includes details such as purchase date and time, payment method, coffee type, and sales amount.

Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we answer key business questions:

- What are the most popular coffee types?

- When are the busiest hours and days for sales?

- How do sales vary across months?

- Which products generate the most revenue?

- What are customers' preferred payment methods?

The insights from this analysis can help with inventory planning, promotional strategies, and operational improvements, and also provide a foundation for future predictive modeling.
